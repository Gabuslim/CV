        <p> <em>The father</em> to <strong>Mia Cerena Akinyi</strong> and a <i>husband</i> to <b>Caroline Nyambura</b></p>
        <p>My name is <strong>Gabriel Omondi</strong>, and I come from <strong>Kenya</strong>.
          I love spending time with my family and cherish the special moments that we share.
          Growing up, I was always interested in technology and design, and so I have been actively pursuing a career in <em><strong>web design and construction</strong></em>.
          I have always had the ambition of studying abroad, and the country that I have had my sights set on is the United States.
          I am confident that with enough hard work and dedication, I will be able to attain my Masters degree there.
          With faith in God, I know that I will make it. Music has always been a major part of my life and I am passionate about music ministry.
          I especially enjoy Tanzanian Swahili slow and fast songs as they remind me of the culture and heritage of my homeland.
          I am always looking for ways to improve myself and I am currently working towards obtaining more professional certifications related to web design and construction.
          I hope to use my knowledge and skills to contribute to the development of technology in the future.
